Hook into platform workflows and add advanced site configuration via the `pantheon.yml` file. To get started, copy [`example.pantheon.yml`](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples/blob/master/example.pantheon.yml) to `pantheon.yml` in the root of your site's code repository.


## Advanced Site Configuration

### Protected Web Paths

If you have files or directories inside of your docroot that you'd like to protect from public web access, use `protected_web_paths`. For example, if you add the following `pantheon.yml` to the root of your site's codebase:

```yaml
api_version: 1

protected_web_paths:
  - /example.txt
  - /example_directory
```

That will ensure that if someone visits `https://example.com/example.txt` or `https://example.com/example_directory/any_nested_file.txt`, both will return a 403 error instead of being displayed.

**Considerations:**

* Specify the exact path; no regex or wildcards allowed
* Paths begin with a leading `/` and are relative to your docroot
* Limited to 24 protected paths
* You may not be able to protect files or paths with special characters
* Wait a few seconds for changes to take effect

### Nested Docroot

If you'd like to nest your docroot one level beneath your code repository in a directory named `web`, you may do so with the following `pantheon.yml`:

```yaml
api_version: 1

web_root: true
```

The name of the nested directory is not configurable. 

For more information, see [Serving Sites from an Alternate Docroot](/docs/alternate-docroot).


### PHP Version

Include `php_version` in your `pantheon.yml` to set the PHP version. Your PHP version will be managed in version control and deployed along with the rest of your site's code. This encourages a good best practice of testing before making a change on your Live site.

```yaml
php_version: 7.0
```

## Quicksilver Platform Integration Hooks

Quicksilver lets you hook into platform workflows to automate your Pantheon workflow. Tell us which script you want to run, and we'll run it automatically every time you or another team member triggers the workflow operation. View (and contribute) to a [growing set of example scripts](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/quicksilver-examples/). Find examples to enable functionality like chat-ops, database sanitization, deployment logging, and automated testing operations with a CI server.

For more information, see [Automate your Workflow with Quicksilver Platform Integration Hooks](/docs/quicksilver).


## Troubleshooting

We will reject a commit that includes a `pantheon.yml` error, with a message like:
```
remote: PANTHEON ERROR:
remote:
remote: Changes to `pantheon.yml` detected, but there was an error while processing it:
remote:
remote:
remote: Version '2' is not a valid pantheon.yml version!
remote: Valid versions are: 1
```

While our parser will reject a `pantheon.yml` that is invalid, it won't necessarily give you the exact reason the file is invalid. Please refer to the examples above for exact syntax.
